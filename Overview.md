# Miles Landing Page

It's a WhatsApp reply assistant tool. The key feature I want to emphasize is that it suggests replies based on the ongoing conversation, but in our own personaâ€”our tone, accent, lingo, and slang. I can also provide more direction for the suggested reply, like generating it based on a specific input tone or adding keywords to guide it towards our intent.

A very important aspect is that we can set a goal for a particular chat, and behind the scenes, the algorithm will work towards achieving that goal, while still considering all the other factors I mentioned. It secretly steers the conversation in the desired direction.

It also acts as a kind of PRM (Personal Relationship Manager) with an in-built dashboard, giving us more control over our conversations so we can manage our relationships with people. This is a secondary feature, but it's significant. Through the dashboard, we can track the health of our conversations in relation to the set goal and customize things further, like tone, relationships, mood, feelings, and many other parameters.
